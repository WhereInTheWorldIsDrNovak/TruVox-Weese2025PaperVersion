**TruVox** is an open-source, accessible software platform for gender-affirming voice coaching, with a current focus on pitch training. Developed by the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/electrical-computer-engineering.html) at the University of Cincinnati, TruVox is intended to supplement professional voice coaching or empower individuals who may not have access to professional resources. This package represents the version of TruVox used for our journal paper "TruVox web-based software for vocal pitch training in transgender women: Development and single-session evaluations" by Weese et al. and is provided as a version of record; keep an eye out for newer versions!

## About TruVox

Our mission is to provide free and accessible gender-affirming voice coaching software for trans people. TruVox is designed as a supportive tool that enables users to practice pitch exercises at their own pace, either independently or alongside professional coaching. While pitch is only one aspect of gender-affirming voice, it is a foundational component and easily accessible to beginners.
> *Note: TruVox is currently under active development! Instructions below may change as the project evolves. This is just the version used for our journal paper and is not our latest build version.*
